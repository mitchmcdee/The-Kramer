# The-Kramer
A lil something I whipped up for the 2017 Tanda Hackathon. Built in half a day so pls take the code with a grain of salt.

Inspired by the "Kramer" painting hanging in Tanda's Brisbane HQ. My project provides a persistent display of your currently clocked-in team in a very aesthetic manner.

# Tech Used:
- Tanda Web Hooks
- [Microsoft Azure Face API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/cognitive-services/face/overview)
- Flask and Waitress (Python 3)
- JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX
- AWS EC2 hosting

# Online Demo:
